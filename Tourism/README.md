## Exercise

Your goal for this assessment is to have an application that allows a user to do the following:
1. Edit an existing State using a pre-populated form.
1. Filter states by time zone using a link on the State Index page.
1. Delete a state using a button on the State Index page.

Create a separate branch for each exercise. Merge each branch into `main` after completing each exercise.

### Editing a State (5 points)

Update the application so that a user can edit an existing State using a pre-populated form.
* e.g. The time zone for `Oregon` should be changed to `Pacific`.
* Do not break any currently passing tests.

Note: Be sure to merge this branch into `main`!

### Filter States by Time Zone (5 points)

Update the application so that a user can filter States by time zone using links on the State Index page.
* Include the following links: `Eastern`, `Central`, `Mountain`, `Pacific`, `Clear Filter`.
	* The application should only display States in the selected time zone.
	* The `Clear Filter` link should display all States.
* e.g. Filtering on `Central` should display the states of `Iowa` and `Texas`.
* Do not break any currently passing tests.

Note: Be sure to merge this branch into `main`!

### Delete a State (5 points)

Update the application so that the user can delete a State using a button on the State Index page.
* The deleted state should no longer appear on the State Index page.
* Deleting a state should also delete all cities in that state.
* e.g. `British Columbia` is not a U.S. state. It should be deleted.
* Do not break any currently passing tests.

Note: Be sure to merge this branch into `main`!

## Questions (5 points)

Edit this file with your answers.

1. What is the difference between `POST` and `PUT`?
	* < Your answer >  

2. What is the purpose of `ViewData`?
	* < Your answer >  

3. If the State model of our Tourism application also has a field for `Region` (e.g. `Midwest`, `South`, etc.), what might the url be if want to filter for States in both the South region and Eastern time zone?
	* < Your answer >  

4. What is the purpose of the `.Remove()` method in the controller code? What do we need to pass in as a parameter when calling `.Remove()`?
	* < Your answer >  

5. If you wanted to improve the UI of the State Index page, what would be the filepath of the CSS file you need to create? (Hint: to find the full path of a project file, right-click the file in Solution Explorer and select `Copy Full Path`. You can then paste the path elsewhere.)
	* < Your answer >
